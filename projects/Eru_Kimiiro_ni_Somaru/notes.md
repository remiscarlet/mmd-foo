Ideas/Notes:
- Generally watch for when bg and fg are both moving quickly. Hard on the eyes and difficult to focus. (Eg, bg and face are both moving in shot a lot such that both are getting blurred.)
- Generally watch out for cam movements with too high a velocity. Hard on the eyes.
- 0:51, start camera with fast velocity to match previous scene "lift off" and decelerate to current vel.
	- Nah. Wrong direction. Maybe with a cut matching same angle.
- 0:31, Really need to figure out wtf is up with that leg/skirt geddan-esque movement.
- 1:02, too zoomed into face. Zoom out a bit to not clip the top of head.
	- Clipping isn't inherently bad but it looks bad when we go from not-clipping, to clipping, then back to not clipping with the camera zooms.
- 1:08, Higher angle so Eru's hand doesn't cover her face as much?

Issues:
- H E L L O L I G H T I N G
- New stage?

History:
- 2020/05/11 - Mostly adjusting framing and interpolation values to be less jerky. No new scenes.
- 2020/05/16 - Added camera movements for 0:55-1:11. Adjusted exposure for lighting. More interpolation changes.
