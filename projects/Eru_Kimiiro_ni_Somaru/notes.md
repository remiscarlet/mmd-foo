Ideas/Notes:
- Generally watch for when bg and fg are both moving quickly. Hard on the eyes and difficult to focus. (Eg, bg and face are both moving in shot a lot such that both are getting blurred.)
- Generally watch out for cam movements with too high a velocity. Hard on the eyes.
- Generally if head is moving in one direction, don't move camera along same axis...? Or maybe do... test.
- 0:51, start camera with fast velocity to match previous scene "lift off" and decelerate to current vel.
	- Nah. Wrong direction. Maybe with a cut matching same angle.
- KiraKira_z with hearts?
- I should uh. Zoom out more.
	- Definitely zoom out more.bv 
- Less jerky motions. Lessen the acceleration on zoom-ins.

Issues:
- I should finish the camera movements.
- 0:31, Really need to figure out wtf is up with that leg/skirt geddan-esque movement.
- 0:51, wtf is up with that DoF spasm
- 1:46, reposition those jump cuts.
- 0:28, I don't like the second jump cut that goes left -> right pan. Maybe vertical movement?

History:
- 2020/05/11 - Mostly adjusting framing and interpolation values to be less jerky. No new scenes.
- 2020/05/16 - Added camera movements for 0:55-1:11. Adjusted exposure for lighting. More interpolation changes.
- 2020/05/18 - How 2 mmd-ray. Added DoF. Lots of mmd-ray adjustments.
- 2020/05/20 - New stage. Minor vmd adjustments. Lighting adjustments. Accidentally removed all interpolation...
- 2020/05/21 - Add second stage. Add cam movements 1:11-1:51. Unlimited Lighting Works. Add particle fx. Readd accidentally removed interpolation.
