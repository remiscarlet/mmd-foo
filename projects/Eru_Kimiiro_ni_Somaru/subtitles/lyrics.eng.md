# 君色に染まる (Kimiiro ni Somaru)

## TL
```
I got my hopes up, just to talk myself down
You're stringing me along with vague answers
I feel like I'm being left behind
and that thought pains me at night

As I meander through my memories of dreams and aspirations
I can almost remember, but it's just out of reach
Nothing would make me happier than
If we were born into this world for each other

Before I knew it, I was dyed with your color
I want you to stain me with your casual words
I've always put up a facade of innocence
Anticipating this very moment

Could it be that we weren't meant for each other?
I'd be lying if I said the thought never crossed my mind
I know I keep getting in your way and I'm sorry, but
All I ever wanted to say was, "I love you"

Even if I search for the right words to not hurt you
I still end up rushing in with half-complete thoughts
Why does this feel all wrong, yet so right?
I'll leave it to you to decide our fates.

Before I knew it, I was dyed with your color

I'd be lying if I said the thought never crossed my mind
I know I keep getting in your way and I'm sorry, but
All I ever wanted to say was, "I love you"

## Changelog
- 2020/05/28, First iteration pass is mostly literal translating. Minimal sentence reordering.
- 2020/05/29, reword to be a bit more natural. Should probably get someone who actually knows English to review.
