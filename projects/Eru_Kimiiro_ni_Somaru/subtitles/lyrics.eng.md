# 君色に染まる (Kimiiro ni Somaru)

## TL
```
I got my hopes up, just to talk myself down
You're stringing me along with vague answers
It's almost like I'm being left behind
and that thought pains me at night

I can almost remember, but not quite
I'm meandering through precious memories 
Wouldn't it be wonderful

If we were born for each other?

Before I knew it, I was dyed with your color
I want you to stain me with those fleeting words of yours
I've always put up a facade of innocence
Anticipating this very moment

Could it be that we weren't meant for each other?
I can't say I've never had those thoughts
I'm sorry I've always gotten in your way
But I just wanted to say I love you

Even if I choose my words to not hurt you
I rush in with half-complete thoughts
It's like we're both right and wrong
I'll leave it to you to decide both our fates

Before I knew it, I was dyed with your color
I want you to stain me with those fleeting words of yours
I've always put up a facade of innocence
Anticipating this very moment

Could it be that we weren't meant for each other?
I can't say I've never had those thoughts
I'm sorry I've always gotten in your way
But I just wanted to say I love you
But I just wanted to say I love you
