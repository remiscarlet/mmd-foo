# 君色に染まる (Kimiiro ni Somaru)

### Ideas/Notes:
- Generally watch for when bg and fg are both moving quickly. Hard on the eyes and difficult to focus. (Eg, bg and face are both moving in shot a lot such that both are getting blurred.)
- Generally watch out for cam movements with too high a velocity. Hard on the eyes.
- Generally if head is moving in one direction, don't move camera along same axis...? Or maybe do... test.
- 0:51, start camera with fast velocity to match previous scene "lift off" and decelerate to current vel.
	- Nah. Wrong direction. Maybe with a cut matching same angle.
- KiraKira_z with hearts?
- I should uh. Zoom out more.
	- Definitely zoom out more.bv 
- Less jerky motions. Lessen the acceleration on zoom-ins.
- Too much movement in the camera overall. Use more "small movement over long time" type moves.
- use kirakira_z or HanaParticle sect3

### Issues:
- I should finish the camera movements.
- 0:51, wtf is up with that DoF spasm
- 1:46, reposition those jump cuts.
- 2:08, that weird dot line artifact thing again...
- 1:28, clipping under the floor
- 1:47, head is cut off frame
- 2:15, cut down to three shots and make third one twice the length of other two (curr 4)

### History:
- 2020/05/11 - Mostly adjusting framing and interpolation values to be less jerky. No new scenes.
- 2020/05/16 - Added camera movements for 0:55-1:11. Adjusted exposure for lighting. More interpolation changes.
- 2020/05/18 - How 2 mmd-ray. Added DoF. Lots of mmd-ray adjustments.
- 2020/05/20 - New stage. Minor vmd adjustments. Lighting adjustments. Accidentally removed all interpolation...
- 2020/05/21 - Add second stage. Add cam movements 1:11-1:51. Unlimited Lighting Works. Add particle fx. Readd accidentally removed interpolation.
- 2020/05/22 - 1:51-2:15 cam movement. Add third stage. Doing _something_ from 2:15-2:22... Fixed a bunch of weird bone positions on Eru. Lots of small tweaks.
