## General notes
- Use focal length variation more
- Default should be with interpolation. Use linear sparingly.
    - Accelerate (x^2) for zoom in/out feel
    - Decelerate (-x^2) for "sliding into next shot" feel
    - tan(x) for 転けた feel
    - tanh(x) for "doppler effect" feel
- Use more continuous shots. Eg, keep continuous motion with direction/focal changes rather than teleporting camera.
    - Shifting speeds while keeping same direction is nice.
    - Consider angle changes with speed shift.
- If the choreo is interesting, chill out on the camera to let the motion shine.
- If the choreo is telling a "story" or symbolic/meaningful movement, try to make camera play along with it.
- Watch more videos while framestepping. 
- How about moving the models so it's not in the same place every damn scene... 
- Move camera along a single axis with tilted angle?
- Use "very slow movement" to "speed up and zoom away" kind of feel 
	- "du-wah" kind of movement if used in repetition
- "Swooping in from above" movement.
- Extreme acceleration but over more frames so feels more dramatic?
- If music is heavily syncopated, use still camera with jump cuts.
- Constant speed but with cuts changing position/angle. Keep the feel with camera moving same speed/same direction.
- Use cuts alternating between two general positions/angles so it kinda feels like you're going back and forth
	- And more generally, keep some sense of continuity between cuts. This will probably help with cuts sometimes feeling like they happen too often
- For slow/non movements on the choreo, use shots from behind.
	- Or just use shots from behind more often.
- If choreo has finger pointing/moving with the model looking in that direction, position camera where they're pointing?



  

## Focal length shift usages
- "Zoom in" feel without zooming in
- Can generally keeps a shot from looking too static (don't overdo though)
