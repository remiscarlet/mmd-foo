# Remilia's [A]ddiction 

## Notes
- We gonna make this one spicy, bois. Turn everything up to 100 and try to do lots of fx.
- If can find a thematicaly matching flan (wtf am I saying- use sakuya), use her in "cutscenes" in MV-esque fashion.
- Song breakdown
	- 4 measure intro
	- 16 measure A section
		- Move remi to roof on second half. On last measure of second half, fly away while fading away to transition to below
	- 8 measure bridge <- "cutscene" with non dance motions? Matching F̶l̶a̶n̶ Sakuya model?
	- 16 measure chorus
	- 4 measure intro '
	- 16 measure A '
	- 8 measure bridge
	- 16 measure chorus
	- 16 measure B section <- show off on cinematographics/fast movements
	- 8 measure bridge
	- 16 measure chorus/outro
- Change camera angle/position every 2-6 beats opting to change on the downbeat or the three.
- Repetition Legitimizes. Use similar but short camera motions in repetition to set a motif. Short "burst" slides, for example. Reset distance to model but change position and repeat general motion.
- Consider "weird angles" (upside down, sideways) for short scenes 
- Generally consider more "non standard" angles. My "default" angles and positions are getting boring/repetitive.
- For fast sections can utilize camera spins more? (Z axis)
- For scene lengths, consider utilizing 2, 4, and 6 beat scenes to portray the "fast", "medium" and "slow" sections of the songs.
- If choreo around face (hand motions?) consider closeup to capture that

## Issues/Todos
- Move position to somewhere on roof for headboom?? Jump between pillars? Idk, get her out from in front.
- follow hand motion more with "midoku notoku to rabukoru"
- Head tilt looks bad. Attach camera to a bone in the face/head area temporarily for tilt?

## MME/Ideas
- When releasing genso v3 trailer also thrown in a "also check out" at the end of trailer for like 10 seconds with excerpts from this video with fade in/outs. High quality shit.
- Start putting in cutscenes of non-dance choreo in "flashes" with fx transitions (screen tear, fade transition, etc)
- Yo, I could make a small stage in minecraft and export that as a second stage model to use in the bridge or smth.
	- Consider using ampitheater in the back too tho
- Utilize shadow fx more
- use ground fog in sequeneces of scenes with color distortion. Snappy camera movements, esp when catching  the ground fog. Bonus if can find choreo of Remilia pointing down.
