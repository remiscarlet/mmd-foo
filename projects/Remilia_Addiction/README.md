# Remilia's [A]ddiction 

## Notes
- We gonna make this one spicy. Turn everything up to 100 and try to do lots of fx.
- If can find a thematicaly matching flan (wtf am I saying- use sakuya), use her in "cutscenes" in MV-esque fashion?
- Song breakdown
	- 4 measure intro
	- 16 measure A section
		- Move remi to roof on second half. On last measure of second half, fly away while fading away to transition to below
	- 8 measure bridge <- "cutscene" with non dance motions? Matching F̶l̶a̶n̶ Sakuya model?
		- Four "scenes" - 2 measures each.
		- Scene 1-2: Scenic shots of SDM. (Consider 2 beats instead of 4 to get 4 shots in)
		- Scene 3: Remi sillhouette on moon
		- Scene 4: Remi on bridge outside her room or center pillar with full moon in background. Eyes closed. Zoom in/open eyes on last 2 beats.
			- White/light flash as transition back into chorus? (Also works as a transition for the fx like desaturation etc)
			- ぽろなう用ポーズ 05-11?
		- "あたしね。。。秘密あるの。。。愛しい人に。。。"
		- "I have a secret... Someone close to me... I think it's..."
		- "an [A]ddiction"
		- "[A]ddictionがあるの"
	- 16 measure chorus
	- 4 measure intro'
	- 16 measure A'
	- 8 measure bridge
	- 16 measure chorus
		- Back gardens
		- Exaggerate camera motions to match the large arm motions
	- 16 measure B section
		- Flashes of stills in other parts of mansion? 1-2 beats long
	- 8 measure bridge
		- Some other "cutscene" or some other new format?
		- 「ねえ、咲夜。。。あたし咲夜のこと。。。」
		- "Hey Sakuya... I think I..."
	- 16 measure chorus/outro
		- On roof? Custom stage? Maybe out front in front of gates to get the "whole SDM" in the shots? Stage would be nice to lift up the camera from ground level (to get more sdm in the bg)
		- Could ask builders...? esp cuz last section - could show everything else I have.
- Change camera angle/position every 2-6 beats opting to change on the downbeat or the three.
- Repetition Legitimizes. Use similar but short camera motions in repetition to set a motif. Short "burst" slides, for example. Reset distance to model but change position and repeat general motion.
- Consider "weird angles" (upside down, sideways) for short scenes 
- Generally consider more "non standard" angles. My "default" angles and positions are getting boring/repetitive.
- For fast sections can utilize camera spins more? (Z axis)
- For scene lengths, consider utilizing 2, 4, and 6 beat scenes to portray the "fast", "medium" and "slow" sections of the songs.
- If choreo around face (hand motions?) consider closeup to capture that
- Generally try to make changes on a per-axis basis. Eg if I want a longer scene to spin z axis, as long as I only modify z axis and I want a y axis spin halfway through that longer scene, I can make adjustments to the y axis while retaining the rate of change on z axis from the longer scene. Kinda like inheritence in a way lol

## Issues/Todos
- Head tilt looks bad. Attach camera to a bone in the face/head area temporarily for tilt?
	- This looks a lot better now but could still improve?
- Floaty hands @ 0:21
- Find better materials. Hat looks like it's made out of denim... (idk, it's kinda growing on me though)
- Airhorns need more impact. Camera doesn't focus on the impact point (is transitioning)
- chorus in general needs to be less claustrophobic - Need contrast with the busiest section - B section.
- The fast camera movement sections should center Remi more. Too much jerking around <<<===
- Sakuya leaning too far to left in thumbnail
- Too much space on right side compared to left in thumbnail 
- =====
- Adjust fadeout with final neck rotation keyframes in third bridge
- Second chorus first kick, make it match second kick better
- Make credits text bridgter or match stone flooring color better.
- Remi feet are floating in final scene w/ credits - probably all scenes from this stage pos?
 
## MME/Ideas
- This is gonna be a pain but I think I can try to hack a shin-esque flan model together with pmxe (Or just sakuya...)
- When releasing genso v3 trailer also thrown in a "also check out" at the end of trailer for like 10 seconds with excerpts from this video with fade in/outs. High quality shit.
- Start putting in cutscenes of non-dance choreo in "flashes" with fx transitions (screen tear, fade transition, etc)
- Yo, I could make a small stage in minecraft and export that as a second stage model to use in the bridge or smth.
	- Consider using ampitheater in the back too tho
- Utilize shadow fx more
- use ground fog in sequences of scenes with color distortion. Snappy camera movements, esp when catching the ground fog. Bonus if can find choreo of Remilia pointing down.
- In general camera should feel "snappier". Too "dull"/"flat" right now
- B section, contrast fast dance choreo with "medium speed" camera movement. Avg every 2 beats. (1/2/4 beats, fast/med/slow)

## Description
TitleJp: 「MMD」 レミリアの「[A]ddiction」
TitleEng: [MMD] Remilia's [A]ddiction

どもす。remidapyonです。

第一作からしばらく時間立ちました。まだまだ未熟者ですが前作と比べては少し腕を上げられたと思います。
まあ、やっぱおぜうさまは最高なんでどうにかレミィの魅力を前面に出せられていれば嬉しいです。

今回は幻想郷をマイクラで作ったコミュニティ「Yukkuricraft」の「幻想郷 V3」のマップを使ったステージです。
「幻想郷 V3」のトレーラー動画はこちらです。どうぞお楽しみください：[Link Here]

どうぞ、第二作の「[A]ddiction」


Sup. remidapyon here.

It's been a while since my first work. While I'm still very much learning the ropes, I'm hoping I've been able to improve my skill since my first video.
Ultimately, I'm hoping that I was able to capture Ojou-sama's beauty and grace. 

This time around I created the stage from Yukkuricraft's Genso v3 map. Yukkuricraft is the community that recreated the entirety of Gensokyo in a fully explorable public minecraft server.
If you would like, please check out the Genso v3 Trailer here: [Link Here]

Anyways, please enjoy my second work: [A]ddiction!
