# Remilia's [A]ddiction 

## Notes
- We gonna make this one spicy, bois. Turn everything up to 100 and try to do lots of fx.
- If can find a thematicaly matching flan, use her in "cutscenes" in MV-esque fashion.

## Issues/Todos
- Zoom in on headboom
- Move position to somewhere on roof? Jump between pillars? Idk, get her out from in front.

## MME/Ideas
- Utilize shadow fx more
- use ground fog in sequeneces of scenes with color distortion. Snappy camera movements, esp when catching  the ground fog. Bonus if can find choreo of Remilia pointing down.
