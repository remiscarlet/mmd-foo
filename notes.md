## General notes
- Use focal length variation more
- Default should be with interpolation. Use linear sparingly.
    - Accelerate (x^2) for zoom in/out feel
    - Decelerate (-x^2) for "sliding into next shot" feel
    - tan(x) for 転けた feel
    - tanh(x) for "doppler effect" feel
- Use more continuous shots. Eg, keep continuous motion with direction/focal changes rather than teleporting camera.
    - Shifting speeds while keeping same direction is nice.
    - Consider angle changes with speed shift.
- If the choreo is interesting, chill out on the camera to let the motion shine.
- If the choreo is telling a "story" or symbolic/meaningful movement, try to make camera play along with it.
- Watch more videos while framestepping. 

## Focal length shift usages
- "Zoom in" feel without zooming in
- Can generally keeps a shot from looking too static (don't overdo though)
